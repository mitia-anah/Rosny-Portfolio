This application allows users to answer questions that are asked randomly in the game’s page. The questions are about guessing a country's flag and a city’s capital. Once the users choose their answer, whether they get it correct or not, they will access a new page that shows the user's score. By getting wrong answers, users will be asked to try again by clicking the try again button. Bug having the answer correct, users win.
Some technologies that were used to build this application:

- REACT
- HTML/CSS.
