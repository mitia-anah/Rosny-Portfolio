This application allows users to answer questions that are asked randomly in the gameâ€™s page. The questions are about guessing a country name given a country flag or a capital city .Once the users choose their answer, whether they get it correct or not, they will access a new page that shows the user's score. By getting wrong answers, users will be asked to try again by clicking the try again button. But having the answer correct, users win. 
The application was only built with REACT and HTML/CSS.
