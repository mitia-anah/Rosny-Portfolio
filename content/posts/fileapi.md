This website is a project that I built from scratch. I used only HTML and CSS to build it, however there is a bit of javascript functionalities used in a specific area. For instance, the image slider. There is also use of the SASS variable, which is a CSS framework that helps with styling management.

The website is mainly just for users to see interesting photos around the world.
