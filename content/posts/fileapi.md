This website is a project that I built from scratch. I only used HTML and CSS to build it, however, there are some javascript functionalities used in a specific area. For instance the image slider. There is also use of the SASS variable, which is a CSS framework that helps with styling management. 

The website is mainly just for users to see interesting photos from different worlds.
