This application is made for users to remember their birthdays. It presents the date and time, users’ avatar, first-names and last-names and their ages. 
This app also contains some features like:
Filtering Name Bar: allows users to search their name by first name or last name.
Filtering Month Bar: allows users to search birthdays by month
Add Button: when users want to add a new list of a birthday.
Delete Button: if the users choose to remove a profile from the list 
Edit Button: whenever the users want to make a change on their profiles.
The application is built with pure vanilla javascript and HTML/CSS3. Data was fetched from an API and using a date format like “date-fns”, allows the application’s date or time to be updated. Date-fns is a modern javascript date utility library, which provides comprehensive functions for date formatting and manipulation.
