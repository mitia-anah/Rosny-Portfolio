This was just an assessment to check my rapidity and my skill on building a website. The main goal of building this site is for me to learn how HTML, CSS work, and how to use them. The assessment helped me a lot as I get more understanding of what they are.</p>\n<p>Dealing with CSS style was my most challenge part, as I had to start from scratch without any new CSS framework yet. However it was fun because I had to use everything in separately, that's way I could learn how to use layout position, such as using Flex and grid layout. Well, my HTML document was a bit messy for the start but then it updated on the way. What is more, writing the HTML was also a lot complicated as I had to think what element tag should I use. Because it was an assessment, there were many requirement that I needed to follow, such as indenting the element and avoiding error or token like missing closing tag. What had been a very helpful tool that Used was the HTMLValidator, which helped me to find token in the whole document.</p>\n<p>Time was the most challenging part for me. We were ordered to finish the task in five days. I found it very hard as I only had a few months of experience with HTML and CSS. The important thing is that I could learn some interesting thing, like using SASS variable to my code, so that I can make my code more cleaner with classifying every style according to what they do. I didn't really know how it works before but I just used it in order to try new thing. Thanks to google which had made my task easier because I had to search an example of how to use them.</p>","fields":{"slug":"fileapi"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"fileapi"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2199005656"]}
