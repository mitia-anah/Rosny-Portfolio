In addition, if they want to include their birthday and some information about them, there is a \"add button\" which allow them to add their own information.</li>\n<li>And third of all, if the users select a row to edit, they can still choose to not edit it by clicking the cancel button or the closing the page by clicking the cross icon instead.</li>\n</ul>","fields":{"slug":"gatsby"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"gatsby"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2199005656"]}
